## KYC procedure 

### Why is a complete KYC implemented?

Due to the progress in the development of the platform and the requirements of our new partnerships, we decided to conduct a full AML/KYC procedure. This is important for scaling and complying with the rules of jurisdictions in which we obtained financial licenses, as well as to confirm that the income of MoneyToken is not a consequence of criminal activity or sanctioned funds.

In addition, это there is a better way to prevent spam, and account farming. Bots can join airdrop and bounty, but they can not pass the KYC check. Therefore, we decided to include airdrop/bounty participants in the KYC/AML process as a means of protecting ourselves (and all legitimate participants).
